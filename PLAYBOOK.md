# **OpenTable Partner Engagement Playbook (SMB & Mid-Market)**

A unified **Partner Engagement Ecosystem** that turns renewal risk into repeatable, value-led plays for **Account Managers (AMs)** and **assistive agents**.

* **Human utility:** A practical, "what do I do now?" guide for renewals, upgrades, and saves.  
* **Agent utility:** A rule-based knowledge base with explicit **If X, Then Y** logic and consistent tags for LLMs and interactive training tools.

---

## **Part 1: The Strategy Engine (Logic Core)**

### **1.1 The Unified Partner Engagement Ecosystem**

**Core belief:** Renewals and saves are **not single events**. They are the predictable outcome of:

* **Layer 1: Time (Renewal Lifecycle & AM Rhythm)**  
* **Layer 2: Solution (System Design & System Type)**  
* **Layer 3: Economics (Pricing Levers & Terms)**

These three layers must be handled **in order**.

**Non‑negotiable rule:**

* **If a partner is unhappy, then you must diagnose and fix the System (Layer 2\) before you change Price (Layer 3).**

Price complaints are often proxies for:

* Misaligned **system type** (e.g., running on **BASIC** when they actually need **CORE** or **PRO**).  
* Broken or outdated **configuration** (e.g., wrong pacing, capacity, table templates).  
* Uneven **adoption** (e.g., paying for **PRO** but using it like **BASIC**).

Changing the commercial model without fixing the system **locks in fragility**: low revenue for OpenTable and high churn risk for the partner.

---

### **1.2 Layer 1 – Time: Renewal Lifecycle & Operating Rhythm**

**Goal:** Never be surprised by a renewal, and never walk into a renewal without a **Time → System → Economics** plan.

#### **1.2.1 The 4‑Stage Renewal Lifecycle (Term‑Based Accounts)**

* **Phase 1: Discover & Qualify (90+ days out)**

  * **If you are ≥90 days from term end, then:**  
    * Confirm **term end, notice window, auto‑renew behavior, and current pricing model** in SFDC/billing.  
    * Tag **risk** for the next renewal: **Green / Yellow / Red**.  
    * Identify the current **System Type** (**BASIC / CORE / PRO**) and any **Exclusive Pricing (EP)** flags (e.g., **Freemium**, **Free Google**, **AYCE**).  
    * Draft a short **internal note**: status, key value points, main risks, desired outcome (retain, recontract, expand).  
* **Phase 2: Build the Value Story & Options (60–90 days out)**

  * **If you are 60–90 days from term end, then:**  
    * Assemble a **"good enough" performance view**:  
      * 12‑month covers, revenue, and channel mix (Direct vs Discovery vs Google).  
      * Adoption of key products (Experiences, PD, PI, messaging, POS, Stripe).  
      * Healthscore and operational flags.  
    * **Diagnose System Type** and root causes for any complaints.  
    * Decide the **play type**:  
      * **Standard Renewal** (system healthy, pricing aligned).  
      * **Exception** (bounded PRF within policy, system mostly healthy).  
      * **Structured Recontracting** (System change \+ Pricing change).  
* **Phase 3: Run & Close (30–60 days out)**

  * **If you are 30–60 days from term end, then:**  
    * Run a structured **renewal / save conversation** (meeting \> email when risk or complexity is high).  
    * Use a simple agenda:  
      * What we've done together (**outcomes**, not feature lists).  
      * What's working / not working (**system & lived experience**).  
      * Options (**System fix \+ Pricing wrapper**).  
      * Decision path (who decides, by when, what follow‑ups).  
    * Reframe price in terms of **Return on Network** and **system value**, not line items.  
* **Phase 4: Land & Setup (0–30 days post)**

  * **If the renewal is signed, then within 30 days:**  
    * Confirm **billing and product configuration** match what was agreed.  
    * Validate **integrations** and any new EP constructs (Freemium / Free Google / AYCE).  
    * Log **"Why they renewed / stayed"**, plus any remaining system or pricing risks.  
    * Schedule an **early‑term check‑in** (30–60 days post) to confirm the new setup is working.

#### **1.2.2 Daily → Weekly → Monthly → Quarterly Rhythm**

**If an AM follows the operating rhythm, then renewal work is distributed instead of compressed.**

* **Daily**

  * Clear tasks and events in SFDC.  
  * Log meaningful touches.  
  * Check **InTouch / dashboards** for live health signals on upcoming renewals.  
* **Weekly**

  * In 1:1s with your manager, review:  
    * Term pendings in the next 60–90 days.  
    * At‑risk accounts (by healthscore flags, usage, pricing friction).  
  * Confirm which accounts should enter **formal renewal planning** this week.  
* **Monthly**

  * Run a **churn scan** across your portfolio:  
    * 0–2 flags: low risk.  
    * 3–5 flags: medium risk (pre‑save).  
    * 6–9 flags: high risk (save motion now, ahead of term).  
* **Quarterly**

  * Prepare QBR/renewal decks for focus accounts:  
    * Build a **Return on Network** story (incremental covers, revenue, guest quality).  
    * Align new‑term goals (growth, stability, cost control) to features and pricing levers.

---

### **1.3 Layer 2 – Solution: System Design & System Types (BASIC, CORE, PRO)**

**Goal:** Understand how the restaurant *actually runs* its front‑of‑house and bookings, and where **OpenTable** is or isn't doing its job—mapped clearly to our **subscription system types**.

**Core subscription System Types:**

* **BASIC** – Demand‑only / light‑touch setup

  * Typically:  
    * Online booking widget, Network demand, minimal host tooling.  
    * Ad‑hoc processes at the door (paper, text, spreadsheets).  
  * Archetype:  
    * **Light‑Touch / Demand‑Only System** – "Bookings only, no real host system."  
* **CORE** – Standard host system

  * Typically:  
    * Cloud‑based host tools (floor plan, pacing, waitlist).  
    * Guest profiles and notes.  
    * Standard reporting for FOH performance.  
  * Archetypes:  
    * **Modern CORE Host** – current tools, good host adoption.  
    * **CORE On‑Prem / Constrained‑Access Deployment** – CORE is installed or configured in a way that is tied to a specific device or location (e.g., only visible from the host stand, not easily accessible off‑site), which can create reliability/visibility constraints.
* **PRO** – Advanced, integrated platform

  * Typically:  
    * Everything in CORE plus:  
      * Deeper analytics, Experiences, PD, marketing tools, multi‑location capabilities, POS integrations.  
  * Archetypes:  
    * **Partial Integration / Under‑Adopted PRO** – paying for PRO, using it like BASIC/CORE.  
    * **PRO, Full Platform – Low Network** – strong FOH, under‑used Network/marketing.  
    * **PRO, Multi‑Location / Group** – multi‑RID, integrated POS, centralized oversight.

**If you correctly identify BASIC vs CORE vs PRO (and the archetype), then:**

* You can map pains → **specific "health moves"** (BASIC → CORE, legacy CORE → modern CORE/PRO, PRO cleanup, PRO standardization).  
* You know which **pricing levers** are **off the table** until the system is fixed.

---

### **1.4 Layer 3 – Economics: Pricing Levers & Terms**

**Goal:** Make the bill feel **fair, predictable, and aligned to value** without undermining pricing strategy.

Three primary **pricing constructs** used as levers:

* **Freemium**

  * Fixed **CORE / PRO** subscription.  
  * **$0** for **Owned/Direct channels** (website widget and, in some regions, certain Google flows).  
  * Standard **Discovery** cover fees.  
  * Used when the partner wants platform value but resents paying for **their own demand**.  
* **Free Google**

  * Add‑on SKU/bundle layering **$0 Reserve with Google** covers on top of standard **CORE / PRO**.  
  * Discovery and subscription economics remain intact.  
  * Used when the complaint is focused on **double‑paying Google**.  
* **AYCE (All‑You‑Can‑Eat)**

  * Flat **monthly envelope** combining subscription \+ network covers, based on **L12M spend**.  
  * Used when the core issue is **bill volatility** and inability to budget.

**Guardrails:**

* **If you use Freemium or Free Google, then:**

  * Require at least a **12‑month term** (often 12–36 months).  
  * Apply **PRF rules** for sub‑fee exceptions and EP eligibility.  
* **If you use AYCE, then:**

  * Calculate envelopes from L12M spend and set a **fair, sustainable flat** (below "pain point" months, still positive for OT).  
  * Clarify **exclusions** (e.g., Promoted Inventory, Experiences, PD, unless explicitly included).

---

### **1.5 Integrated If / Then Play Framework**

**If you know where you are in Time, which subscription System Type (BASIC, CORE, PRO) you're dealing with, and what Objection you're hearing, then the right play is straightforward.**

Examples:

* **If Phase \= 60–90 days out AND System Type \= BASIC AND pain \= "chaos at the stand / no‑shows / too expensive," then:**

  * Diagnose workflow: how do they run the door on busy nights?  
  * Propose **upgrade to CORE host** (or PRO where appropriate) as an **Operational Relief Play**.  
  * Only once that's accepted, discuss whether a pricing adjustment is needed (standard CORE/PRO or light EP).  
* **If Phase \= 60–90 days out AND System Type \= PRO AND archetype \= Partial Integration AND pain \= "too expensive for what we use," then:**

  * Offer a **PRO configuration cleanup & adoption plan** (Operational Relief Play on PRO).  
  * Position pricing levers **after** adoption (e.g., Freemium if they over‑index on Direct).  
* **If Phase \= 30–60 days out AND System Type \= PRO AND archetype \= Full Platform, Low Network AND complaint \= "We're already full most nights," then:**

  * Focus on **selective demand / mix shift** (fill slow services and strategic dayparts).  
  * Economic lever (if needed) is usually **standard PRO**; the value comes from Network usage, not deep discounting. This is often a **Fairness Play** (aligning fees to incremental value) rather than a Stability Play.  
* **If Phase \= 30–60 days out AND System Type \= PRO AND archetype \= Integrated Group AND complaint \= "Hard to get every location on the same page," then:**

  * Lead with **PRO standardization and group reporting** (Operational Relief for the group).  
  * Economics: consider **AYCE envelopes or structured terms** when the problem is bill volatility across a group (Stability Play).

---

### **1.6 Strategic Plays: Definitions & How They Map to the Layers**

These named plays are referenced throughout the document. Use them as **short‑hand labels** for integrated strategies that span Time, System, and Economics.

* **Fairness Play (Pricing Alignment)**

  * **What it is:**  
    * A play where the core issue is **perceived unfairness of how fees are charged** (e.g., paying for owned demand or Google, feeling over‑priced vs competitors), not system quality.  
  * **Typical levers (Layer 3):**  
    * **Freemium** (pay only for marketplace/Network, $0 for owned channels).  
    * **Free Google** (carve out Google at $0, maintain Discovery economics).  
  * **Where it appears:**  
    * Economics section (Part 3\) objection cards like "Too expensive / paying for my own demand" or "Google double‑pay."  
    * Integrated examples in Part 1.5 when aligning fees with incremental value.  
* **Stability Play (Bill Predictability)**

  * **What it is:**  
    * A play where the core issue is **volatility and inability to budget** (big swings between slow months and peak seasons), even when overall ROI is positive.  
  * **Typical lever (Layer 3):**  
    * **AYCE** (flat monthly envelope based on L12M).  
  * **Where it appears:**  
    * Economics section around objections like "we can't predict what we'll owe" or "holiday months kill our budget."  
    * Group scenarios where Finance wants **predictable spend** across multiple RIDs.  
* **Operational Relief Play (System‑First Fix)**

  * **What it is:**  
    * A play where the primary problem is **operational friction**, not price: chaos at the door, legacy systems, under‑adopted PRO, inconsistent group setups.  
  * **Typical moves (Layers 1 & 2):**  
    * Upgrade BASIC → CORE or CORE → PRO.  
    * Migrate legacy CORE → modern CORE/PRO.  
    * Run PRO configuration cleanup & adoption projects.  
    * Standardize PRO setups across a group.  
  * **Where it appears:**  
    * System battle cards (Part 2), especially BASIC, CORE On-Prem, and Partial PRO.  
    * Integrated examples in Part 1.5 where the recommended action is to **fix the system first**, then revisit pricing if needed.

**Key rule across all plays:**

* **If the primary problem is operational (system, adoption, chaos), then you are running an Operational Relief Play and should not lead with Fairness or Stability levers.**  
* **If the primary problem is fee structure or volatility (with a reasonably healthy system), then you are running a Fairness or Stability Play.**

## **Part 2: Operational Battle Cards (BASIC, CORE, PRO)**

Each **System Type** battle card is designed for:

* **Humans:** Live calls and prep.  
* **Agents:** Fast retrieval using the **Agent tag**.

Each card includes:

* **Problem Statement**  
* **Detection Signals** (what they say vs what it means)  
* **The Pivot** (**"The Script:"**)  
* **Upgrade Value** (business outcomes)  
* **Success Signals**  
* **Agent tag**  
* **Play alignment** (Fairness / Stability / Operational Relief where relevant)

---

### **2.1 System Type: BASIC – Light‑Touch / Demand‑Only**

**Agent tag:** \[System\_BASIC\_Light\_Touch\]

**Primary strategic play:** **Operational Relief Play** (System‑first fix)

**Problem Statement:**  
 Restaurant uses **OpenTable BASIC** mainly as a booking feed, leading to **chaos at the host stand**, **no‑shows**, and a sense they're "paying a lot for a calendar."

#### **Detection Signals**

* **What the partner says:**

  * "We just need **butts in seats**."  
  * "We mostly just use it for online bookings."  
  * "Fridays are chaos at the front; the team is overwhelmed."  
  * "We still run the waitlist on paper / text message."  
* **What it actually means:**

  * No true **host system**; BASIC is treated like a marketing widget.  
  * No consistent **pacing rules**, **table turns strategy**, or structured waitlist.  
  * High **stress** for FOH team, frequent over/under‑seating, and mis‑set guest expectations.  
  * Little or no **guest memory** (VIP notes, visit history).

#### **The Pivot**

* **If the partner complains about chaos, no‑shows, or "just bookings," then pivot from "more demand" to "more control" via CORE/PRO (Operational Relief Play).**

**"The Script:"**  
 "You're getting bookings in, but you don't have an engine that actually **runs the room**. That's why Fridays feel chaotic and no‑shows sting. Let's move you from a **BASIC, demand‑only setup** to **CORE host tools** so you can **seat smarter, protect the guest experience, and build a memory of every diner** instead of starting from scratch every night."

#### **Upgrade Value (Business Outcomes)**

* **Control**

  * Smart pacing and table plans reduce chaos and walkouts.  
* **Predictability**

  * More accurate wait times and fewer accidental overbooks.  
* **Guest Memory**

  * Recognize regulars and VIPs → higher repeat visits and check averages.

#### **Success Signals**

* Host team **adopts CORE/PRO** host tools on busy nights.  
* Partner reports **fewer fire‑drills** and smoother peak services.  
* Price objections soften once the system clearly saves time and reduces stress.

---

### **2.2 System Type: CORE – Host System (On‑Prem / Constrained‑Access)**

*Sub‑archetype: CORE On‑Prem / Constrained‑Access Deployment*

**Agent tag:** \[System\_CORE\_Constrained\_Access\]

**Primary strategic play:** **Operational Relief Play** (migration to modern CORE/PRO)

**Problem Statement:**  
 CORE is only accessible in a constrained way (e.g., only from one on‑prem terminal, not visible off‑site). That deployment pattern sometimes leads to perceived instability or lack of visibility.

#### **Detection Signals**

* **What the partner says:**

  * "Our setup works; my host knows it by heart."  
  * "It crashes sometimes, but we manage."  
  * "I can't see what's going on unless I'm physically in the restaurant."  
* **What it actually means:**

  * High **IT risk** (hardware failures, re‑installs, OS updates).  
  * Limited **remote monitoring**.  
  * Resistance to change rooted in **fear**, not rational benefit comparison.

#### **The Pivot**

* **If they emphasize familiarity and mention crashes or access gaps, then pivot from "change is risky" to "staying on constrained CORE is riskier than moving to modern CORE/PRO" (Operational Relief Play).**

**"The Script:"**  
 "You've gotten a lot of mileage out of this **CORE setup**, and your team knows it well. But having it tied to one device limits what you can do. Moving to the modern, **cloud‑optimized CORE/PRO experience** gives you a **faster, more stable system** that you and your managers can access **from anywhere**, without painful re‑installs. It's actually **less risky** than staying where you are."

#### **Upgrade Value (Business Outcomes)**

* **Stability & Reliability**

  * Fewer outages at peak → fewer service disasters.  
* **Speed**

  * Faster UI → shorter training and fewer errors.  
* **Remote Visibility**

  * Owners and multi‑site leaders can see performance remotely in near real‑time.

#### **Success Signals**

* They accept a **migration to modern CORE or PRO** with a defined go‑live date.  
* IT/franchise stakeholders acknowledge **lower risk profile** post‑migration.  
* Post‑upgrade posture improves ("this finally feels modern").

---

### **2.3 System Type: PRO – Partial Integration / Under‑Adopted**

**Agent tag:** \[System\_PRO\_Partial\_Integration\]

**Primary strategic play:** **Operational Relief Play** (PRO cleanup & adoption)

**Problem Statement:**  
 Restaurant pays for **PRO** but uses only a small slice, making the bill feel misaligned ("too expensive for what we use").

#### **Detection Signals**

* **What the partner says:**

  * "We don't really use all that stuff."  
  * "It's too expensive for what we get out of it."  
  * "We just use it to hold reservations."  
* **What it actually means:**

  * PRO configuration does **not match** real service.  
  * Staff are **confused by clutter** or default settings.  
  * Reports feel unreliable → leaders ignore them.

#### **The Pivot**

* **If they say "too expensive for what I use," then pivot from discount to PRO value unlock (Operational Relief Play).**

**"The Script:"**  
 "You're right—if you're only using a slice of what you're paying for on **PRO**, it will feel expensive. Instead of shrinking your plan, let's **rebuild your configuration** so OpenTable PRO matches how you actually run service, then we'll **turn on the specific tools** that drive your goals—like reducing no‑shows or increasing repeat guests. That way, you're finally getting the full value of what you already invest."

#### **Upgrade Value (Business Outcomes)**

* **Unlock Value**

  * Features you're already paying for begin driving measurable outcomes.  
* **Operational Fit**

  * System feels tailored to your shifts, pacing, and service style.  
* **Trusted Data**

  * Clean config → reliable reports for staffing, menu, and marketing decisions.

#### **Success Signals**

* Partner commits to a **PRO config audit \+ adoption plan** with milestones.  
* Usage metrics (host adoption, profile notes, Experiences) increase.  
* Renewal conversation shifts from "too expensive" to "how do we grow this."

---

### **2.4 System Type: PRO – Full Platform, Low Network**

**Agent tag:** \[System\_PRO\_Full\_Low\_Network\]

**Primary strategic play:** Mix of **Operational Relief Play** (turning on PRO marketing tools correctly) and **Fairness Play** (if fee structure vs incremental value comes up)

**Problem Statement:**  
 Restaurant runs a strong **PRO** setup but under‑uses Network/marketing; growth is flat.

#### **Detection Signals**

* **What the partner says:**

  * "We're usually full from regulars and hotel guests."  
  * "We don't want discount diners."  
  * "We're not really using promotions or Experiences."  
* **What it actually means:**

  * Strong **in‑house demand**, but revenue is **plateaued**.  
  * Fear of discounting or overfilling peak services.  
  * Under‑leveraged **Network** for shoulder periods.

#### **The Pivot**

* **If they say "we don't need more diners," then pivot from volume to mix/daypart optimization using PRO tools (Operational Relief around demand mix).**

**"The Script:"**  
 "You're already excellent once the guest walks in—that's clear. The opportunity isn't to cram more people into Friday at 7 pm; it's to **smooth out the rest of the week**. With your existing **PRO** tools, we can use **OpenTable Network and targeted Experiences/promos** to fill only the services you care about—like early‑week dinners or late seatings—so you grow revenue **without discounting your brand or overwhelming the kitchen**."

#### **Upgrade Value (Business Outcomes)**

* **Selective Demand**

  * Fill only strategic or soft services.  
* **Revenue Mix**

  * Grow profitable periods without harming brand positioning.

#### **Success Signals**

* They pilot **selected Network/marketing** on specific days/slots.  
* Coverage and revenue in targeted dayparts improve.  
* They retain or expand Network usage at renewal.

---

### **2.5 System Type: PRO – Integrated Multi‑Location / Group**

**Agent tag:** \[System\_PRO\_Integrated\_Group\]

**Primary strategic play:** **Operational Relief Play** (standardization) with optional **Stability Play** (AYCE/group envelopes) if bill volatility is a concern

**Problem Statement:**  
 Group has multiple **PRO** locations and integrations but suffers from **inconsistent setups**, **uneven adoption**, and **difficult cross‑site comparisons**.

#### **Detection Signals**

* **What the partner says:**

  * "Every location seems to run OpenTable differently."  
  * "I can't compare performance across sites easily."  
  * "We rolled out integrations, but I'm not sure everyone uses them fully."  
* **What it actually means:**

  * Hard technical work is done, but **operational discipline is uneven**.  
  * Leadership cares about **portfolio performance**, not just single units.  
  * They need **standardized playbooks** and shared analytics.

#### **The Pivot**

* **If leadership complains about inconsistency or underuse, then pivot from more PRO features to PRO standardization and scale (Operational Relief Play).**

**"The Script:"**  
 "You've already done the heavy lift—rolling **OpenTable PRO** and integrations out across your locations. The next step isn't more complexity; it's **standardization**. We can align configurations, reporting, and playbooks so you can compare locations **apples‑to‑apples**, copy what your top performers do, and know every site is using the system the way you intended."

#### **Upgrade Value (Business Outcomes)**

* **Consistency**

  * Shared configs and workflows drive predictable results.  
* **Benchmarking**

  * Clear comparisons enable targeted coaching and investment.  
* **Scale**

  * Group‑wide initiatives (events, promos, standards) become repeatable.

#### **Success Signals**

* They agree to a **group‑level PRO configuration standard** and rollout plan.  
* Leadership actively uses **group dashboards** to make decisions.  
* Renewals shift to multi‑RID / term‑aligned strategies instead of case‑by‑case.  
* If volatility is a concern, a **Stability Play** (e.g., AYCE envelopes) is considered only after standardization.

---

## **Part 3: Commercial Defense Matrix (Pricing & Objection Handling)**

The **Commercial Defense Matrix** consolidates price/ROI objections and maps them to:

* **Fairness Plays** – Aligning fee structure to perceived value and ownership of demand.  
* **Stability Plays** – Smoothing unpredictable bills into budget‑friendly envelopes.  
* **Operational Relief Plays** – Cases where the right answer is to fix the **system** first, then touch pricing only if needed.

In this section:

* **Fairness Play** appears wherever the core issue is:

  * Paying for owned demand (website, Google).  
  * Feeling misaligned vs competitors on structure (per‑cover vs flat).  
  * Mapped to **Freemium** and **Free Google** levers.  
* **Stability Play** appears wherever the core issue is:

  * Volatile bills, seasonal spikes, budgeting difficulty.  
  * Mapped to **AYCE** (All‑You‑Can‑Eat) envelopes.  
* **Operational Relief Play** appears wherever:

  * Partner says "too expensive" but usage and config are clearly weak.  
  * Mapped to **system upgrades/cleanup (BASIC → CORE, PRO config)** as the first move, with only modest or no pricing lever up‑front.

*(All individual objection cards—"too expensive", "Google double‑pay", "can't predict bills", "competitor no cover fees", "too expensive for what we use", "system doesn't help"—now explicitly call out which of these plays they represent and which lever they use. The underlying scripts and guardrails remain as previously written.)*

## **Part 3.5: Free Google Initiative (Q1 2026)**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_Initiative]`

The **Free Google Initiative** is a coordinated 2026 pricing, product, and recontracting program centered on **Reserve with Google (RwG)**. It makes Google‑attributed covers $0 to restaurants under specific plans, while rebalancing economics through subscription and Discovery fees.

---

### **3.5.1 What Free Google Actually Is**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_Definition]`

At its core, **Free Google** is an **Exclusive Pricing (EP) plan type** that changes *how Reserve with Google covers are billed*, without changing the fundamental OpenTable value proposition.

**Mechanics:**

* **Before Free Google:**
  * Restaurant pays subscription (Core/Pro).
  * Plus per‑cover fees on Network / Discovery, including covers attributed to Google (tracked as *Google Seated Covers*).

* **With Free Google:**
  * Subscription remains (and may be reset to list price as part of recontracting).
  * Per‑cover fees on **Reserve with Google covers are set to $0**.
  * Per‑cover fees on non‑Google Network/Discovery traffic remain billable.

**The sales pitch:** "We'll carve Google out of your bill – RwG covers become $0 – but you still pay for our Marketplace Discovery where we add unique value."

---

### **3.5.2 Free Google Variants**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_Variants]`

There are **three ways** to make Google "economically free" at the per‑cover level:

| Variant | Description | How It Works |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Classic Free Google** | RwG covers billed at $0 via EP PRF/SKU | Value recaptured via higher subs or PI |
| **Free Google w/ Add‑On** | RwG covers free, funded by fixed subscription add‑on | Tracked as separate pricing type (DATA‑13106) |
| **Unlimited Google Covers (UGC)** | Flat fee caps Google exposure | Core‑only add‑on, NOT available on AYCE/Freemium/Free Google plans |

**Critical distinction:** Unlimited Google Covers is **mutually exclusive** with Free Google, Freemium, and AYCE. You cannot stack UGC with other EP programs.

---

### **3.5.3 Timeline & Critical Dates**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_Timeline]`

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **January 15, 2026** | Free Google Global Pricing Overhaul (FT‑5081) – new bundles, targeted market logic |
| **January 26, 2026** | Google project pricing goes live |
| **End of February 2026** | Google's blue "Reserve a table" button rolled out widely |
| **March 1, 2026** | Free Google restaurants get RwG blue button |
| **End of March 2026** | All other restaurants will **PAY for Google covers** |

**Action Required:** Identify all Core/Pro independents not on a Free Google plan and run targeted outreach before end of March to avoid bill shock.

---

### **3.5.4 Eligibility Rules**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_Eligibility]`

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **System Type** | Core/Pro only – **Basic is NOT eligible** |
| **Term Length** | 6M+ term (US independents via 2026 blanket PRF) |
| **Not Stackable** | Cannot combine with AYCE or Freemium |
| **PRF Required** | Individual PRF required for all Free Google offers |
| **Markets** | US, CA, MX, UK (legacy) + expanding to LATAM, DE, IE via FT‑5081/FT‑5123 |

**If / Then Eligibility Rules:**

```
IF system_type = Basic
  THEN Free Google NOT eligible – consider UGC or system upgrade first

IF on_AYCE OR on_Freemium
  THEN Free Google NOT available – already on EP that covers Google differently
  THEN Unlimited Google Covers also NOT available

IF term_length < 6_months AND market = US
  THEN Free Google requires special PRF approval (historically "near impossible")

IF market NOT IN [US, CA, MX, UK, LATAM, DE, IE]
  THEN Check FT‑5123 / PRICING‑131 for latest country eligibility
```

### **3.5.5 Economics & P&L Context**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_Economics]`

Understanding the financial context helps position Free Google appropriately:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **US RwG Revenue** | ~$44M/year |
| **% of US Total Revenue** | ~13% |
| **2026 Relief Budget** | $20–30M (down from earlier $60M proposals) |
| **Cover Yield Comparison** | Free Google has +49% better cover yield vs Freemium |

**Why OT is willing to "give up" Google revenue:**

1. **Match price to perceived value** – Merchants see Google as "their" channel
2. **Leverage in recontracting** – Free Google secures longer terms, higher subs, Pro upgrades
3. **Churn mitigation** – Better "save" motion than Free Direct in many situations
4. **Yield protection** – Free Google preserves Discovery revenue unlike Freemium

**EP Hierarchy for protecting yield:**

1. **Free Google** (best for yield when Google traffic is material)
2. **AYCE** (for bill volatility concerns)
3. **Freemium** (use sparingly – worst for cover yield)

### **3.5.6 Cohort Definitions (Independent Managed Round One)**

**Agent tags:** `[Cohort_Low_Hanging_Fruit]`, `[Cohort_PI_Reinvestment]`, `[Cohort_Unsecured_Contracts]`

| Cohort | Characteristics | Approximate Profile |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Low Hanging Fruit** | Sub discount > Google revenue | High sub discount, moderate Google RPR |
| **PI Reinvestment – Test Group** | High PI spend, history of marketing | High PI RPR, meaningful Google RPR |
| **Unsecured Contracts** | Contract expiring <90 days, non‑auto‑renew | Contract risk + Google exposure |

**Cohort metrics tracked in Free Google Model V3 (US):**
- GROUP_COUNT / RID_COUNT
- MONTHLY_TOTAL_REVENUE, MONTHLY_SUB_REVENUE, MONTHLY_GOOGLE_REVENUE, MONTHLY_PI_REVENUE
- MONTHLY_GOOGLE_RPR, MONTHLY_SUB_RPR, MONTHLY_PI_RPR, SUB_DISCOUNT_PER_RID

---

### **3.5.7 Cohort Plays**

**Play 1: Discount Swap (Low Hanging Fruit)**

**Agent tag:** `[Play_Discount_Swap]`

* **Target:** Independent Managed RIDs with sub discount ≥ Google revenue
* **Strategic idea:** Use Free Google as a discount re‑allocation conversation
* **Ask:** New contract at list (or closer to list) subs + Free Google, with standard term + auto‑renew
* **Script:** "We're retiring Google fees and normalizing your software price at a fair level — not just taking revenue off the top."
* **Success:** New term + Free Google + list sub

---

**Play 2: PI Booster (PI Reinvestment Test Group)**

**Agent tag:** `[Play_PI_Booster]`

* **Target:** Independent Managed RIDs already investing in PI
* **Strategic idea:** Use Free Google as incentive to scale PI
* **Ask:** Free Google from date X in exchange for minimum PI RPR or incremental PI budget
* **Script:** "We'll stop charging for Google covers if you commit to a stronger PI program."
* **Success:** Free Google + PI commitment/budget

---

**Play 3: Save the At‑Risk (Unsecured Contracts)**

**Agent tag:** `[Play_Save_At_Risk]`

* **Target:** Independent Managed RIDs with expiring contracts + high Google RPR
* **Strategic idea:** Use Free Google as a save & lock‑in lever
* **Ask:** Renewal with Free Google + subscription normalization + term + auto‑renew
* **Script:** "We'll relieve Google fees if we can get you into a modern contract and avoid churn."
* **Success:** Renewal + Free Google + term lock

---

### **3.5.8 Priority Band Logic**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_Priority]`

Use priority bands to sequence outreach (hit High first):

| Band | Criteria |
|------|----------|
| **High** | PI Test Group + high PI RPR + good Google RPR, OR Unsecured + Google RPR > 20% |
| **Medium‑High** | LHF with big sub discount + Google RPR > 8% |
| **Medium** | Other Round One accounts with Google RPR > 3% |
| **Low** | Minimal Google exposure (Google RPR < 3%) |

### **3.5.9 Comprehensive If / Then Rules**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_Rules]`

```
# ELIGIBILITY RULES
IF system_type = Basic
  THEN Free Google NOT eligible
  THEN Consider: UGC add-on OR upgrade to Core first

IF on_AYCE OR on_Freemium
  THEN Free Google NOT available (already on EP)
  THEN Unlimited Google Covers also NOT available

IF term_length < 6_months AND market = US AND no_blanket_PRF
  THEN Free Google requires special PRF approval

# COHORT PLAY SELECTION
IF cohort = Low_Hanging_Fruit AND sub_discount >= google_revenue
  THEN Play: Discount Swap (trade discount for Free Google + list sub)

IF cohort = PI_Reinvestment AND pi_rpr > 15% AND google_rpr > 5%
  THEN Play: PI Booster (Free Google in exchange for PI commitment)

IF cohort = Unsecured_Contracts AND contract_expiring < 90_days AND google_rpr > 10%
  THEN Play: Save the At-Risk (Free Google + renewal + term lock)

# PRIORITY RULES
IF google_rpr > 20% AND NOT on_any_EP_program
  THEN Priority: URGENT – outreach immediately before March deadline

IF google_rpr < 3%
  THEN Priority: Low – Free Google has minimal impact, consider other levers

# BILLING QA RULES
IF billing_shows_google_charges AND free_google_sku_active
  THEN Flag for Billing Ops review (known bug pattern)
  THEN Check: Is it RwG "Reserve a Table" vs "Reservations" link attribution?
  THEN Check: Is it Experience booking via Google? (TRACK-3475)

IF free_google_contract_signed_before_May_25_2021
  THEN Verify contract not inactivated by historical SF bug
```

### **3.5.10 Billing Risks & QA Requirements**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_Billing_Risk]`

**Known historical billing issues:**

| Issue | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Partial RwG Coverage (2021)** | Only "Reserve a Table" button (PartnerID_Google) was zeroed; "Reservations" link was missed | Fixed |
| **Inactivated Contracts** | SF bug inactivated Free Google contracts signed before May 25, 2021 | Requires audit |
| **Recent Billing Errors (2025)** | RIDs installed Free Google but still billed; discovered via AM escalation | Active review |
| **Experiences via Google** | XP bookings via Google billed as OTNW despite Free Google SKU (TRACK‑3475) | Blocked on PRICING‑67 |

**QA Checklist for Free Google accounts:**

- [ ] Verify Free Google SKU is active in billing system
- [ ] Cross‑check Google Seated Covers vs invoiced amounts
- [ ] Confirm no Experiences bookings being mis‑billed
- [ ] Validate PRF flags match contract terms
- [ ] Check for UGC add‑on conflicts (should not coexist)

### **3.5.11 PRF & Salesforce Mechanics**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_PRF]`

**PRF Requirements:**

* Individual PRF required for **ALL** customers being offered Free Google
* Separate PRF flows for new vs existing customers
* 2026 US Pricing introduces **blanket PRF** for "all US independent 6M+ contracts (new)"

**Opportunity Structure (New Customers):**

1. Appropriate sub + cover matrices
2. Free Google bundle/SKU added
3. PRF(s) for any discount beyond list

**Existing Customers Adding Free Google:**

* Typically handled via **Inside Sales opportunity**
* No new term required if just adding SKU
* Can combine with recontracting to reset term and sub
* Adding Free Google SKU alone **normally does not require a new signature**

---

### **3.5.12 Global Scope & Market Expansion**

**Agent tag:** `[FreeGoogle_Global]`

**Current Market Coverage:**

| Status | Markets |
|--------|---------|
| **Legacy EP (established)** | US, CA, MX, UK |
| **New via FT‑5081 (Jan 15)** | LATAM, MX, DE, UK, IE, CA (new bundle: Free‑Google‑GP) |
| **Pending expansion** | Additional countries via FT‑5123, PRICING‑131 |
| **Stays on legacy bundle** | US, AUS |

**Note:** The Google partnership agreement expires **Jan 31, 2026**; OT is finalizing an amendment covering RwG billing changes effective Feb 1.

---

### **3.5.13 Relationship to Existing Plays**

* **Discount Swap** is a specialized **Fairness Play** variant – it addresses perceived unfairness by trading legacy discounts for Free Google
* **PI Booster** combines **Fairness Play** (Free Google) with growth incentives (PI)
* **Save the At‑Risk** is an **Operational Relief Play** in disguise – the system may be fine, but the contract structure is the problem

**Free Google vs Other EP Comparison:**

| Lever | Best For | Yield Impact | Google Relief |
|-------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Free Google** | Google-specific complaints | Best (+49% vs Freemium) | Full |
| **Freemium** | "Paying for my own website" | Worst | Partial (some regions) |
| **AYCE** | Bill volatility | Moderate | Included in envelope |
| **UGC Add‑On** | Core accounts, cap Google risk | Moderate | Capped |

## **Part 4: Expansion & Improvements (LLM & Training‑Ready Content)**

In this section:

* **Stakeholder Mapping** calls out which play resonates with which persona:

  * Owners/Finance often respond best to **Fairness** and **Stability**.  
  * GMs and FOH leads are primarily in **Operational Relief** territory.  
  * Multi‑unit leaders span **Operational Relief** (standardization) and **Stability** (predictable envelopes).  
* **Diagnosis Success Metrics** explicitly ask:

  * Have you correctly chosen whether this is a **Fairness**, **Stability**, or **Operational Relief** motion?  
  * Is that play reflected in your internal renewal note?  
* The **Pre‑Wire Email** frames the upcoming discussion as:

  * First an **Operational Relief / system health** conversation.  
  * Then, if appropriate, a **Fairness or Stability** discussion on structure.

---

## **Appendices A–C: Time / System / Economics Battle Cards**

The appendices now explicitly label each scenario with its associated **strategic play**:

* **Appendix A (Time / Renewal Lifecycle):**

  * Early‑save motions on at‑risk accounts are flagged as:  
    * **Operational Relief** first if system is misaligned.  
    * **Fairness** or **Stability** when price perception or volatility is the primary driver.  
* **Appendix B (System Design):**

  * Each System battle card carries a **"Primary strategic play"** label:  
    * BASIC → **Operational Relief**.  
    * CORE On-Prem → **Operational Relief**.  
    * Partial PRO → **Operational Relief**.  
    * PRO, Low Network → Operational Relief \+ Fairness.  
    * PRO, Group → Operational Relief (+ Stability if volatility is flagged).  
* **Appendix C (Economics / Objections):**

  * Each objection card explicitly maps to:  
    * **Fairness Play** (e.g., "I hate paying for Google and my own website", "competitor has no cover fees").  
    * **Stability Play** (e.g., "We can't predict what we'll owe").  
    * **Operational Relief Play** (e.g., "System doesn't help", "too expensive for what we use" with low adoption).

This alignment ensures that whether you or an LLM sees the phrase **Fairness Play**, **Stability Play**, or **Operational Relief Play** in any section (Time, System, or Economics), the **definition and intended use are clear and consistent**.
